AI / Internet / Course Sources Documentation

Sources I used to answer Question 1:
1. Lecture slides from class:
   - oo-terminology.ppt
   - ooHeuristics.pptx
   - CRCCards.ppt
   These slides were reviewed to reference definitions of cohesion, coupling, 
   and Arthur Riel’s Object-Oriented Heuristics.

2. AI: ChatGPT
   Purpose: Helped organize and structure my written response clearly.

Summary:
- All definitions were taken from the class Lecture slides and some from chatgpt.
