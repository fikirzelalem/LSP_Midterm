AI / Internet /Course Sources Documentation

Sources I used to answer Question 4:
1. Source: Course lecture slides: "Introduction to Java" and "OO Terminology"
I reviewed the concepts of inheritance, abstract classes, and interfaces.

2. Web Source: Oracle Java Documentation
   URL: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/abstract.html
Skimmed through abstract classes define shared state and partial behavior, while interfaces define capabilities that can be mixed into multiple classes.

4. AI- ChatGPT
   Prompt used: 
   “Explain how to implement DoorLock, Thermostat, and Camera classes in Java using inheritance and interfaces based on a given Device abstract class.”
   Short excerpt: 
   “Each concrete class should extend Device and implement Networked (and BatteryPowered where required). Ensure all fields are private and that constructors call super(id, location).”

Summary: 
   Used AI to clarify structure and validate correct syntax.
