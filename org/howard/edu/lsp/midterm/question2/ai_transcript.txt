Prompt asked : “I created overloaded methods for calculating the area of a circle, rectangle, 
triangle, and square. Can you check if my syntax and exception handling are correct?”

Excerpt from response:
“Everything looks correct — each overloaded method throws an 
IllegalArgumentException for invalid input and uses Math.PI for circle area.”
