Prompt asked : “I created overloaded methods for calculating the area of a circle, rectangle, 
triangle, and square. Can you check if my syntax and exception handling are correct?”

Excerpt from response:
“Everything looks correct — each overloaded method throws an 
IllegalArgumentException for invalid input and uses Math.PI for circle area.”

Prompt 2:
“I want to verify that my overloaded AreaCalculator methods use the correct 
formulas and exception handling.”

Excerpt response:
“Each overloaded method can share the same name area but with different parameter 
signatures. Validate dimensions (≤ 0) by throwing IllegalArgumentException. Use Math.PI 
for the circle’s area.”
