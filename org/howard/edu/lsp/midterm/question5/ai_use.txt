Reflection on AI Use in Learning and Problem Solving

Throughout this course, I have used AI tools such as ChatGPT and Grok AI to support my understanding 
of several Java concepts like inheritance, composition, and CRC card structure. These tools helped me 
understand and clarify syntax errors, review lecture topics, and double check my reasoning before 
finalizing my codes. AI has helped me to test my logic and understand how object-oriented design 
principles apply in real programming tasks.
One major benefit I experienced was the immediate feedback that I was getting, AI made it easier to 
understand why my approach worked or failed without waiting till class arrives to understand it. However, I
also learned that depending on it too much can weaken my debugging skills, so I always verified results 
by compiling, running, and testing it on my own. Going forward, I plan to use AI as a structured learning 
assistant for brainstorming and review, but never as a substitute for critical thinking. Professionally, 
I expect it to become an essential tool for code documentation, design reviews, and fast iteration on 
software solutions.
