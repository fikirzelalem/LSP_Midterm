AI / Internet / Course Sources Documentation

Sources I used to answer Question 3:

1. Source: Course lecture slides on "OO Terminology" and "ooHeuristics.pptx"
- Applied concepts of composition vs. inheritance, class cohesion, and Riel’s heuristic.

2. Source: Course lecture slides on "crcCards.ppt"
Checked that responsibilities and collaborations should be separated to avoid tightly coupled class relationships when refactoring.

4. AI Assistance (ChatGPT)
   Prompt used:
   “Explain how to redesign a Car class to support dynamic trim-level changes using composition rather than inheritance.”
   Short excerpt:
   “You can create a TrimLevel class and give Car a reference to it, allowing you to swap the TrimLevel instance at runtime instead of subclassing for Base, Luxury, and Sport.”
   
Summary:
Used AI to confirm understanding of composition vs. inheritance and to ensure use of correct terminology.
