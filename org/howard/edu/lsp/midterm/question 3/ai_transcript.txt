Prompt used:
   “Explain how to redesign a Car class to support dynamic trim-level changes using 
   composition rather than inheritance.”
   
   Short excerpt:
   “You can create a TrimLevel class and give Car a reference to it, allowing you to swap 
   the TrimLevel instance at runtime instead of subclassing for Base, Luxury, and Sport.”

   Prompt 2:
   “Can you confirm whether composition would allow changing trim levels dynamically?”

    Excerpt response:
    “Yes. Instead of subclassing BaseCar, LuxuryCar, etc., make Car contain a TrimLevel 
    object. This composition allows the trim to change at runtime without altering inheritance.”
