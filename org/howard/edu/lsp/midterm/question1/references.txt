AI / Internet / Course Sources Documentation

Sources I used:
1. Lecture slides from LSP:
   - oo-terminology.ppt
   - ooHeuristics.pptx
   - CRCCards.ppt
   These slides were reviewed to reference definitions of cohesion, coupling, 
   and Arthur Riel’s Object-Oriented Heuristics.

2. AI: ChatGPT
   Purpose: Helped organize and structure my written response clearly.

Example prompt used:
"Using Arthur Riel’s heuristics from the course slides, explain whether 
the StudentPortalHelper class has high or low cohesion and how to refactor it."

Excerpt from response:
“A well-designed class should have high cohesion. According to Arthur Riel’s 
heuristics, a class should capture one and only one key abstraction. The 
StudentPortalHelper class mixes unrelated functions (UI, finance, security, etc.), 
resulting in low cohesion.”

Summary:
- No code or external web content was used to do this question.
- All definitions were taken from the class Lecture slides.
