Prompt I asked:
"Using Arthur Riel’s heuristics from the course slides, explain whether 
the StudentPortalHelper class has high or low cohesion and how to refactor it."

Excerpt from response:
“A well-designed class should have high cohesion. According to Arthur Riel’s 
heuristics, a class should capture one and only one key abstraction. The 
StudentPortalHelper class mixes unrelated functions (UI, finance, security, etc.), 
resulting in low cohesion.”
